Feature: Defining a presentation as a path through the image

  When the landscape of the presentation is layed out, itâ€™s time to think about
  a specific path through this landscape. Therefore landmarks need to be defined
  at some points and a list of landmarks needs to be stored to define a sequential
  path. This path can then be used to jump between these landmarks to stop at this
  point and tell the audience something about the content that is shown.
